This handheld console was originally made as a school project but has continued to
be developed and evolved. I plan on keeping this project with me for as long as 
I can and develop some games every now and then. I have detailed schematics that 
will eventually be scanned and put up on here but if you are interested in having
them sooner, feel free to contact me through the means posted above and I can send you
an early copy.
