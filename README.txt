This was a self-lead school project meant to explore the utility of shift registers when paired with Arduino. This was also an homage to my very first electronics project of a similar, but much more rudimentary design that was made 1.5 years prior 







Unusual Commit History Explanation
- The Workaround branch was made because I had been having trouble uploading to the game console due to the parts being cheap knockoffs. Thankfully I found a workaround but it required me to use a different computer and the fastest way I found to implement this workaround was by creating a seperate branch and pushing every time I wanted to test something.
- What did this mean? In order to attempt to hasten that bulky pipeline, I did not be including detailed commit messages, if any. It will also mean that most of my pushes will be non-functional and typically not meant to be seen in public.
- In order to combat the previously stated problems with this system, I have attempted to highlight important pushes with !!!![title]!!!!. This will hopefully allow you to sieve through the commits and find the important ones.
- Lastly, the problem has now been fixed and developement will now continue normally.
